# plxphp: the PHP dialect

plxphp lets you write PostgreSQL functions with PHP syntax. At `CREATE FUNCTION`
time plx transpiles the body to plpgsql and stores the plpgsql in
`pg_proc.prosrc`. The function runs on the standard plpgsql interpreter.

The language name is `plxphp`, so it does not collide with the native PL/PHP.

## Setup

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION plx;
```

## Function basics

Blocks are brace-delimited and statements end with `;`. A scalar function ends
with an explicit `return`.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION add(a int, b int) RETURNS int LANGUAGE plxphp AS $$
return $a + $b;
$$;
```

Function arguments are referenced with the `$` sigil, which is removed in the
generated plpgsql. Any SQL expression is valid, because expressions are passed
through to plpgsql and SQL unchanged.

### Local variables and types

Assignment creates a local. plx infers the type from the first value when it is
an integer, numeric, text, or boolean literal. Otherwise annotate the variable
with a `/*:: type */` comment placed before the `;`.

```sql
$n = 42;              // inferred integer
$label = "count";     // inferred text
$amount /*:: numeric */;
$amount = $principal * $rate;
```

The annotation text is emitted verbatim, so `%TYPE` and `%ROWTYPE` work:

```sql
$e /*:: emp%ROWTYPE */;
$s /*:: emp.sal%TYPE */;
```

A constant uses the `const` suffix in the annotation:

```sql
$pi = 3.14159 /*:: numeric const */;
```

## Control flow

### if / elseif / else

```sql
if ($score >= 90) { $grade = "A"; }
elseif ($score >= 80) { $grade = "B"; }
else { $grade = "F"; }
```

`else if` is also accepted.

### switch

`switch` lowers to plpgsql `CASE`. Stacked labels become a value list. Each arm
must end with `break` or a terminating statement (`return`/`throw`); genuine
fall-through is rejected.

```sql
switch ($n) {
  case 1: return "one";
  case 2: case 3: return "few";
  default: return "many";
}
```

### Loops

Counting `for` and `while`:

```sql
for ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {
  $total = $total + $i;
}

while ($n > 0) { $n = $n - 1; }
```

`continue` and `break` map to `CONTINUE` and `EXIT`.

### Loop labels

```sql
outer: for ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) {
  for ($j = 1; $j <= $n; $j++) {
    if ($i + $j >= $limit) { break outer; }
  }
}
```

## Working with data

### Iterating a query

```sql
foreach (query("SELECT id, amount FROM orders WHERE grp = {$g}") as $row) {
  $total = $total + $row->amount;
}
```

The row variable is a record. Field access is `$row->col` or `$row['col']`. For
bind parameters or non-literal SQL, pass extra arguments:
`query($sql, $a) as $row`.

### Iterating an array

```sql
$v /*:: int */;
foreach ($values as $v) {
  $total = $total + $v;
}
```

The loop variable must be annotated with its element type.

### Fetching one row

```sql
$u = fetch_one("SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id = {$uid}");
return $u->name;
```

`fetch_one` returns all-NULL on no row. `fetch_one!` raises on zero or more than
one row.

### Running SQL

```sql
perform("UPDATE counters SET n = n + 1 WHERE id = {$cid}");
execute("INSERT INTO t(msg) VALUES ($1)", $note);
return_query("SELECT id FROM vip ORDER BY id");   // set-returning function
```

Use bind arguments in `execute` for untrusted input.

### Cursors

```sql
$c = open_cursor("SELECT v FROM t ORDER BY v");
$row = fetch_from($c);
while (found()) {
  $total = $total + $row->v;
  $row = fetch_from($c);
}
close_cursor($c);
```

`move_cursor($c)` and `move_cursor($c, $n)` map to `MOVE`.

### Diagnostics

```sql
$rc = row_count();   // GET DIAGNOSTICS $rc = ROW_COUNT
found()              // the FOUND variable
```

### Set-returning functions

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION squares(n int) RETURNS SETOF int LANGUAGE plxphp AS $$
for ($i = 1; $i <= $n; $i++) { return_next($i * $i); }
return;
$$;
```

## Errors

### Throwing

```sql
throw new Exception("negative: {$v}");
```

The call form `raise("notice", "message")` emits a `RAISE` at the named level
(`notice`, `warning`, `info`, `log`, `debug`, `exception`).

### Handling

```sql
try {
  execute("INSERT INTO uniq(id) VALUES ($1)", $k);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
  raise("notice", "dup on " . $e->constraint);
} finally {
  perform("INSERT INTO log(msg) VALUES ('done')");
}
```

`catch (\Exception $e)` maps to `WHEN OTHERS`. To catch a specific condition,
name it with the `PG::` spelling, for example `catch (PG::UniqueViolation $e)`,
which maps to `unique_violation`.
Accessors: `$e->message` to `SQLERRM`, `$e->sqlstate` to `SQLSTATE`, and
`$e->detail`, `$e->hint`, `$e->constraint`, `$e->column`, `$e->table`,
`$e->schema`, `$e->datatype` to the matching `GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS` fields.

### Assertions

```sql
assert($n > 0, "must be positive");
```

## Expressions

- Interpolation: `"total is $amount"` and `"count {$n}"` splice the value.
  Single-quoted strings do not interpolate.
- Concatenation: `$a . $b` maps to `$a || $b`.
- Comparison: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==` map to `=` and `<>`. `$x == null` becomes
  `$x IS NULL`.
- Boolean: `&&`, `||`, `!` map to `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.
- Ternary: `$c ? $a : $b` becomes `CASE WHEN $c THEN $a ELSE $b END`.
- `null` becomes `NULL`.

## Building strings in a loop

Concatenating onto a string in a loop is slow in plpgsql: `s := s || 'x'` is
O(n^2) because text is immutable and each step copies the whole string. Use the
append assignment `.=`, which plx lowers to its string builder (`plx_strbuild`):

```sql
$s = "" /*:: text */;
foreach (query("SELECT name FROM t ORDER BY id") as $row) {
  $s .= $row->name;
  $s .= ",";
}
return $s;
```

On PostgreSQL 18 this is amortized O(1) per append. On PostgreSQL 13 to 17 it is
correct but not accelerated (the in-place optimization needs a PostgreSQL 18
feature).

## Trigger functions

A function returning `trigger` can be used as a trigger. Assign to `$NEW` fields
and return `$NEW`:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION stamp() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plxphp AS $$
$NEW->tag = "row {$NEW->id}";
return $NEW;
$$;
```

`$NEW`, `$OLD`, and the `TG_` variables are available. Assigning to a record
field (`$NEW->col = e`) or an array element is supported.

## Semantic differences

These are intentional. plx pins semantics to SQL and plpgsql.

- Decimal literals infer `numeric`, not a floating-point type.
- Comparisons use SQL three-valued logic: `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==` map to `=`
  and `<>`, so a comparison involving NULL is unknown. Only a comparison with the
  literal `null` becomes `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`. A positive `if`/`while`
  condition treats NULL as false.
- `===` and `!==` do not preserve PHP strict-type semantics; they behave like
  `==` and `!=` and use SQL type resolution. `"1" === 1` is false in PHP but
  compares as equal here. Compare like-typed values.
- Interpolating a NULL renders as an empty string; the whole string is never
  made NULL.
- Integer division and modulo follow SQL (truncate toward zero).
- PHP truthiness is not emulated. A condition must be a boolean expression. A
  non-boolean condition is an error reported by plpgsql when the function runs.
- Locals are function-scoped, matching PHP function scope.

## Not supported

Rejected at `CREATE FUNCTION` time with a line number:

- Function or class definitions, namespaces, `use`, includes.
- Closures and anonymous functions.
- Array and object literals as general values.
- Non-counting `for`; only `for ($v = LO; $v < HI; $v++)` and
  `for (...; $v += K)` are supported.
- `foreach` over an array key/value pair (only value iteration).
- `switch` fall-through (end each case with `break` or `return`).
- Per-block local `DECLARE` (locals are function-scoped by design).
